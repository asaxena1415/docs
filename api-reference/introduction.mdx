## Authentication

CalStudio uses API keys for authentication. Include your API key in the Authorization header of every request:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.calstudio.com/v1/apps \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

3. Click **Generate New Key**
4. Store your key securely - it won't be shown again

<Warning>
  Keep your API keys secure and never expose them in client-side code or public repositories. Treat them like passwords.
</Warning>
