## How Message Limits Work

<Warning>
  When you reach your monthly message limit, you'll receive an email notification to upgrade your plan. Your apps will continue working temporarily, but will stop accepting new messages if you don't upgrade within the grace period.
</Warning>

- Each user input and AI response counts as one message
- Message counts reset on your monthly billing date
- Email notifications are sent when you reach 80% of your limit
- Apps require plan upgrade to continue after reaching the limit
