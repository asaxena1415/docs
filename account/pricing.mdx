#### How Upgrades Work

And if you want to customize the number of messages you want to have, please mail us at support@calstudio.com we would be happy to discuss more.

#### In summary:

Free and Lite customers always pay the same price. Pro and Pro Plus users can choose their monthly message allowance—pricing increases as you select higher message limits.
