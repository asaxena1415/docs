Restrict access to your AI app by setting up an access code. This feature allows you to control who can use your app without requiring full user authentication.

## Setting Up an Access Code

1. Open your app in the editor
2. Navigate to the **More** tab
3. Enter your desired access code in the "Access Code" field
4. Save your changes

  alt="Access Code Configuration"
  style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }}
/>

When someone tries to access your app, they'll need to enter the code to proceed. Leave the access code field blank for unrestricted access.

<Tip>
  Access codes are great for beta testing, exclusive communities, or paid access outside of the built-in payment system.

## Revoking User Access

You can revoke access for individual users through the App Analytics dashboard:

1. Go to your app's **Analytics** section
2. Click on **Manage Users**
3. Find the user whose access you want to revoke
4. Click **Revoke Access** next to their email

/>

<Warning>
  Revoking access is immediate. The user will no longer be able to use your app until you restore their access or they re-authenticate.
</Warning>
