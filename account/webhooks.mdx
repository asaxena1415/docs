## What are wehbhooks?

    A webhook is a way for one app to automatically send information to another app in real time whenever something specific happens, like a notification or data update.<br/>

    Webhooks are a core feature in automation platforms like Zapier and Make.com—they allow these tools to connect apps together and trigger workflows instantly when something happens in another app.

### Using Webhooks in CalStudio

    Integrate CalStudio with automation tools like Make.com or Zapier by connecting your webhook URL. This allows you to receive real-time notifications whenever specific events occur in your application.

#### How to Set Up

    1. **Enter your webhook URL**
        Add the webhook URL provided by your Make.com or Zapier workflow.

    2. **Choose when to trigger the webhook**
        Select the event that should activate the webhook. You can choose from:

            - **Message is Sent**: Triggers whenever a user sends a message.

            - **New User Signs Up**: Triggers whenever a new user completes the signup process.

            - **Custom Conditions**: Define advanced logic for triggering the webhook using a custom prompt.

    3. Using Custom Conditions


        - If you select Custom Conditions, enter a prompt describing when the webhook should be triggered.

        - This prompt will be checked against the user’s message history.

        - Example: If a user asks for a discount in their messages, trigger the webhook to summarize and send the details to your automation tool.

#### Sample Webhook Request

    When the webhook is triggered, CalStudio will send a POST request to your URL with a JSON body structured as follows:

    <CodeGroup>

        ```json JSON
        {
        "event": "Message sent",
        "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
        "app_name": "My App",
        "user_email": "user@example.com",
        "user_name": "John Doe",
        "last_message": "User message",
        "response": "App response message"
        }
        ```

    </CodeGroup>

    - event: The type of event that triggered the webhook ("Message sent", etc.).

    - timestamp: The exact time the event occurred, formatted as ISO8601.

    - app_name: The name of your CalStudio app.

    - user_email: The user's email address.

    - user_name: The user's display name.

    - last_message: The most recent message sent by the user.

    - response: The system's response to the user.

This flow ensures your Make.com or Zapier workflows receive timely, useful information for any event or condition you specify—automating business logic, notifications, and more with minimal setup.
