A message refers to a single unit of communication exchanged between a user and the assistant within a conversation.

## Characterstics

    - ### Origin:
        - User Message: Input sent by the user, such as text, images, or other supported content.
        - Assistant Message: Output generated by the GPT model in response to a user message.

    - ### How Messages Work:
        The number of messages counted in your usage depends on whether external tools like Google Search or Image Generation are used during the interaction.

        1. Without Google Search or Image Generation
        Count: One message
        Explanation:
        If the GPT can answer your question based solely on its built-in training and configuration, your input (text or voice) and the bot’s response together count as one message.
       <Card title="Example" >
           <span className="text-red-400">User</span>: "What is the capital of France?"  <br/>
           <span className="text-red-400">Assistant</span>: "The capital of France is Paris." <br/>
           <span className="text-red-400">Total</span>: 1 message
        </Card>
        2. With GPT Image Generation or Google Search
           Count: Two message
           Explanation: If you have turned on the GPT Image Generation feature or the Google Search feature, then a single user input and the assistant’s reply will be counted as two messages.
            <br/>
            **Reason**:
            Once your input is received, the GPT may need to go to other sources to gather information or generate content.

                - In the previous scenario (without these features), GPT answered using only its existing training data.

                - With Google Search turned on, if you ask for latest or real-time information, GPT will actively retrieve it from external sources to ensure accuracy.

                - With Image Generation turned on, GPT will process your request through the image creation system before responding. <br/>

        This extra step in retrieving or generating content is what makes the interaction count as two messages.
         <Card title="Example" >
           <span className="text-red-400">User</span>: "Who won the FIFA World Cup in 2022 and what was the final score?"   <br/>
           <span className="text-red-400">Assistant</span>: (Uses Google Search to retrieve latest or external information)   <br/>
           "The 2022 FIFA World Cup was won by Argentina, defeating France 3–3 in regular time and winning 4–2 on penalties." <br/>
           <span className="text-red-400">Total</span>: 2 messages
        </Card>
    - #### Using OpenAI Assistant with Your Own API Key
      If you use the OpenAI Assistant with your own OpenAI API key, messages exchanged during that
      usage will not be counted towards the monthly message limit in CalStudio.
       This means you can interact with the assistant independently through your API key without
        affecting your monthly quota in the app.
