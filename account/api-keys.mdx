An API Key is a unique identifier used to authenticate requests made from your application to CalStudio APIs.
Think of it as a secure access badge that allows your application to use CalStudio’s services safely.

At CalStudio we allow you to use our APIs using the API keys that we generate for you.

### Creating Your API Keys

You can generate and manage your API keys directly from your CalStudio Dashboard.
Steps to Create an API Key:

1. Log in or Sign up

   - Visit calstudio.com and log in with your credentials.

   - If you don’t have an account, sign up to access the dashboard.

2. Navigate to API Keys Section

   - On the left-hand sidebar of the dashboard, locate and click on API Keys.

3. Generate a New Key

   - Click the Create API Key button.

   - Provide a label or description (optional, but recommended to help you identify usage).

   - Your new API key will be generated instantly.

4. Copy and Store Securely

   - Copy the key and keep it in a secure location.

### Best Practices for Using API Keys

- Keep it secret → Never share your key publicly (e.g., GitHub, client-side code).

- Restrict usage → Apply restrictions (IP, domain, or service-level) when possible.

- Rotate regularly → Regenerate keys periodically and update your applications.

- Revoke if compromised → Immediately delete and regenerate your key if you suspect unauthorized use.
