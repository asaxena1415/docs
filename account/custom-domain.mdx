<Info>
  Custom domains allow you to publish your CalStudio AI apps on your own branded domain, providing a seamless experience for your users without any CalStudio branding.
</Info>

## Overview

With custom domains, you can:
- Host your AI apps on your own domain (e.g., `chat.yourdomain.com`)
- Maintain complete brand consistency
- Build trust with professional URLs
- Improve SEO and discoverability

## Prerequisites

Before setting up a custom domain, ensure you have:

  <Card title="CalStudio Pro Plan" icon="credit-card">
    Custom domains are available on Pro plans and above
  </Card>
  <Card title="Domain Ownership" icon="globe">
    A registered domain with DNS management access
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Create and Launch Your App

1. Follow the [Quickstart Guide](/quickstart) to create your AI app
2. Configure and test your app thoroughly
3. Click **"Launch"** to make it live

### Step 2: Configure Custom Domain

1. In your app's dashboard, locate the **Status** section
2. Click **"Publish"** → **"Custom Domain"**
3. Enter your desired domain:
   - **Root domain**: `yourdomain.com`
   - **Subdomain**: `chat.yourdomain.com` (recommended)

### Step 3: Configure DNS Settings

CalStudio will provide DNS records based on your domain type:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Subdomain (Recommended)">
    For subdomains like `chat.yourdomain.com`:
    
    1. **You'll receive a CNAME record** from CalStudio
    2. Add this record to your DNS provider:
       ```
       Type: CNAME
       Name: chat (or your chosen subdomain)
       Value: [provided-by-calstudio].calstudio.app
       TTL: 3600 (or default)
       ```
    3. Save your DNS changes
    
    <Note>
      Subdomains are easier to configure and don't affect your main website or email settings.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Root Domain">
    For root domains like `yourdomain.com`:
    
    1. **You'll receive NS (Name Server) records** from CalStudio
    2. This requires NS delegation at your domain registrar
    3. Update your domain's nameservers to:
       ```
       ns1.calstudio.app
       ns2.calstudio.app
       ns3.calstudio.app
       ns4.calstudio.app
       ```
    
    <Warning>
      NS delegation affects your entire domain. All DNS records (including email) must be managed through CalStudio after delegation.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Step 4: Verify Deployment

1. **Wait for DNS propagation** (usually 5-30 minutes for CNAME, up to 48 hours for NS)
2. Visit your custom domain
3. Your AI app should now be live!

<Tip>
  Use [DNS Checker](https://dnschecker.org) to verify your DNS records have propagated globally.
</Tip>

## SSL Certificates

<Check>
  CalStudio automatically provisions and manages SSL certificates for all custom domains using Let's Encrypt. Your app will be served securely over HTTPS.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Domain not working after 48 hours">

  <Accordion title="SSL certificate errors">
    - CalStudio automatically handles SSL certificates
    - If using Cloudflare, ensure proxy is disabled (DNS only)
    - Allow up to 24 hours for certificate provisioning
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Email stopped working (root domain)">
    - This occurs with NS delegation
    - You'll need to recreate MX records in CalStudio's DNS manager

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Want to remove custom domain">
    - Remove the domain in CalStudio dashboard first
