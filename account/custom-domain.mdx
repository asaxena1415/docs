To set up your documentation on a custom domain, you’ll need to set your desired custom domain in your Calstudio dashboard and configure your DNS settings on your domain provider.

### Prerequisites

- A CalStudio account

- A registered domain (or subdomain) that you want to connect

- Access to your domain’s DNS settings

#### Steps to Publish a Custom GPT App

1. To begin, navigate to the [Quickstart](/quickstart) and follow the instructions to create your first AI Bot.

2. Launch and Publish

   - In the app’s dashboard, locate the Status row and click Publish.

   - Choose Custom Domain (you may also choose other publishing options, like a CalStudio-hosted link).

3. Connect Your Custom Domain

   - Enter the domain name or subdomain (e.g., chat.mydomain.com) you want to bind the app to.

   - After submitting, CalStudio will generate NS records for you.

   - Update your domain’s DNS settings with the provided records.

   <Note>
     ⚠️ Note: DNS propagation can take 24–48 hours before the changes are live.
   </Note>

4. Verify Deployment

   - Once DNS updates have propagated, visit your custom domain.

   - Your Custom GPT app should now be live and accessible publicly.

#### Troubleshooting

    - If the app doesn’t appear after 48 hours, confirm that your NS records are correctly configured.

    - Check propagation status using free DNS lookup tools.

    - Ensure no conflicting records (e.g., CNAME or A records) exist for the same domain.

### Next Steps

    - Customize the branding, UI, and integrations to make the GPT app fit seamlessly with your domain.

    - Share your domain link with users without requiring them to sign up on CalStudio.

✨ That’s it! You’ve successfully published your GPT app to your own custom domain using CalStudio.
