<Info>
  Custom domains allow you to publish your CalStudio AI apps and App Studios on your own branded domain, providing a seamless experience for your users without any CalStudio branding.
</Info>

## Overview

Custom domains solve a major limitation of AI chatbots - the ability to share and deploy them on your own website. With CalStudio, you can:
- Host your AI apps on your own domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com` or `chat.yourdomain.com`)
- Share your apps publicly without requiring user sign-ups
- Maintain complete brand consistency
- Build trust with professional URLs
- Improve SEO and discoverability
- Embed apps directly on your existing website

## Prerequisites

Before setting up a custom domain, ensure you have:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="CalStudio Pro Plan" icon="credit-card">
    Custom domains are available on Pro plans and above
  </Card>
  <Card title="Domain Ownership" icon="globe">
    A registered domain with DNS management access
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Step-by-Step Setup Process

### Step 1: Sign Up and Access Dashboard

1. Sign up on the [CalStudio platform](https://calstudio.com/)
2. Once signed up, you'll see your dashboard

### Step 2: Create Your AI App

1. Click on the **"Create App"** button in your dashboard
2. Fill out the app creation form with:
   - **App Name**: Choose a descriptive name
   - **Description**: Brief explanation of your app's purpose
   - **AI Model**: Select your preferred model (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claude, etc.)
   - **System Prompt**: Define your AI's behavior and personality
   - **Knowledge Base**: Optionally upload files for your AI to reference
3. Click **"Create App"** to generate your AI application

### Step 3: Test and Launch Your App

1. Test your app thoroughly using the built-in chat interface
2. Make any necessary adjustments to the prompt or settings
3. When satisfied, click **"Launch"** to make it publicly available

### Step 4: Publish to Custom Domain

1. In your app's dashboard, find the **Status** row
2. Click on the **"Publish"** option
3. Select **"Custom Domain"** from the publishing options
4. Enter your desired domain:
   - **Root domain**: `yourdomain.com`
   - **Subdomain**: `app.yourdomain.com` or `chat.yourdomain.com`

### Step 5: Configure DNS Settings

CalStudio will provide DNS records based on your domain type:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Subdomain (Recommended)">
    For subdomains like `chat.yourdomain.com`:
    
    1. **You'll receive a CNAME record** from CalStudio
    2. Add this record to your DNS provider:
       ```
       Type: CNAME
       Name: chat (or your chosen subdomain)
       Value: [provided-by-calstudio].calstudio.app
       TTL: 3600 (or default)
       ```
    3. Save your DNS changes
    
    <Note>
      Subdomains are easier to configure and don't affect your main website or email settings.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Root Domain">
    For root domains like `yourdomain.com`:
    
    1. **You'll receive NS (Name Server) records** from CalStudio
    2. These will be AWS Route 53 nameservers (not CalStudio nameservers)
    3. At your domain registrar, update your nameservers to the provided AWS records, which typically look like:
       ```
       ns-1234.awsdns-12.org
       ns-5678.awsdns-34.co.uk
       ns-9012.awsdns-56.com
       ns-3456.awsdns-78.net
       ```
    4. This process can take 24-48 hours to propagate globally
    
    <Warning>
      NS delegation affects your entire domain. All existing DNS records (including email, subdomains, etc.) will need to be recreated in the new DNS system. Consider using a subdomain instead if you have existing services on your root domain.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Step 6: Verify Deployment

1. **Wait for DNS propagation** (usually 5-30 minutes for CNAME, up to 48 hours for NS)
2. Visit your custom domain
3. Your AI app should now be live!

<Tip>
  Use [DNS Checker](https://dnschecker.org) to verify your DNS records have propagated globally.

![Publish Options](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*UrRtbr4V4UA0YSXB.png)

Select "Custom Domain" to publish it to a custom domain. You'll then need to provide the domain name:

![Domain Input](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*a18QdaRH5b72M0rB.png)

### 6. Configure DNS Records

After entering your domain, you'll receive DNS records to configure:

#### For Subdomains
When publishing to a subdomain (e.g., `app.yourdomain.com`), you'll receive two CNAME records:

<img src="/images/subdomain-record.png" alt="CalStudio Subdomain DNS Records Example" width="800" />

**Example records you'll receive:**

1. **SSL Certificate Validation Record**: 
   - This CNAME record is required for SSL certificate validation
   - It will have a long, unique name starting with an underscore
   - The value points to AWS Certificate Manager for validation

2. **Website CNAME Record**: 
   - This points your subdomain to your CalStudio app
   - Name: Your chosen subdomain (e.g., `app.yourdomain.com`)
   - Value: An AWS load balancer URL

**Important:** After adding these records, your website will be available at your custom domain. The first CNAME record is specifically for SSL certificate validation.

#### For Root Domains
Root domains will receive NS (nameserver) records as described in the DNS settings section above.

## App Studios Custom Domains

<Info>
  App Studios (bundles of multiple AI apps) can also be published to custom domains using the same process. This allows you to create your own AI marketplace under your branded domain.
</Info>

The publishing process for App Studios is identical to individual apps. When you select "Custom Domain" from the publishing options, you'll see the domain input modal:

<img src="/images/studio-publish.png" alt="App Studio Custom Domain Input" width="600" />

After entering your domain:
- You'll receive the same DNS records (CNAME for subdomains or NS for root domains)
- Configure them in your DNS provider following the instructions above
- Your entire App Studio marketplace will be accessible at your custom domain
- All apps within the studio will be available under your branded domain

## SSL Certificates

<Check>
  CalStudio automatically provisions and manages SSL certificates for all custom domains using AWS Certificate Manager. Your app will be served securely over HTTPS.

    - TTL: 1 hour
    
    5. Save both records
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Namecheap">
    1. Sign in to Namecheap
    2. Go to **Domain List** → **Manage**
    3. Select **Advanced DNS**
    4. Click **Add New Record**

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Domain not working after 48 hours">
    - Verify DNS records are correctly configured
    - Check for typos in the domain name
    - Ensure no conflicting A or AAAA records exist
    - Contact support with your domain details
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="SSL certificate errors">
    - CalStudio automatically handles SSL certificates
    - If using Cloudflare, ensure proxy is disabled (DNS only)
    - Allow up to 24 hours for certificate provisioning
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Email stopped working (root domain)">
    - This occurs with NS delegation
    - You'll need to recreate MX records in CalStudio's DNS manager
    - Consider using a subdomain instead to avoid email issues
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Want to remove custom domain">
    - Remove the domain in CalStudio dashboard first
    - Then update/remove DNS records at your provider
    - Your app will revert to the CalStudio subdomain
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
