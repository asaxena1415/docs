  This guide will walk you through creating your first custom AI app on CalStudio. You'll learn how to configure, customize, and deploy a fully functional AI application without writing any code.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- A CalStudio account ([Sign up free](https://calstudio.com/signup))
- An idea for your AI app (customer support bot, educational tutor, content generator, etc.)

## Step 1: Access Your Dashboard

1. Navigate to [CalStudio.com](https://calstudio.com/login)
2. Log in with your credentials
3. You'll be directed to your [dashboard](https://calstudio.com/dashboard) where you can manage all your AI apps

## Step 2: Create Your AI App

### Select Your AI Model

1. Click the **"Create App"** button on your dashboard
2. Choose from our selection of cutting-edge AI models:
   - **OpenAI** (GPT-4, GPT-3.5)
   - **Anthropic** (Claude)
   - **Meta** (Llama)
   - **Google** (Gemini)

<Note>
  No API keys required! CalStudio handles all the technical complexity for you.
</Note>

## Step 3: Configure Your App

The app builder interface is divided into two sections:
- **Configuration Panel** (left): Multiple tabs for customizing your app
- **Live Preview** (right): See your changes in real-time

### Basic Configuration

In the **Basics** tab, set up your app's core functionality:

1. **App Identity**
   - Upload a logo for brand recognition
   - Set your app name (internal identifier)
   - Choose a display name (what users will see)
   - Write a compelling description

2. **AI Configuration**
   - Select your specific model version (e.g., GPT-4 Turbo)
   - Define the AI's behavior with a clear system prompt
   - Set a welcoming message for first-time users

3. **Access Control**
   - Toggle login requirements
   - Configure user authentication settings

<Tip>
  Your system prompt is crucial! Be specific about what your AI should and shouldn't do. For example: "You are a friendly customer support agent for an e-commerce store. Always be helpful, professional, and try to resolve issues quickly."
</Tip>
### Monetization Setup (Optional)

Navigate to the **Credits** tab to configure how users access your app:

1. **Free Tier Settings**
   - Set number of free messages per user
   - Enable monthly reset for recurring free access

2. **Payment Options** (if monetizing)
   - **One-time Payments**: Users purchase message credits
   - **Subscription Model**: Monthly recurring access

3. **Pricing Configuration**
   - Select your currency (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.)
   - Set your pricing structure
   - Example: $5 for 50 messages, $10 for 150 messages

<Info>
  CalStudio uses Stripe for secure payment processing. Payments are available globally with support for multiple currencies.
